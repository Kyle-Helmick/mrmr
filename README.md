# mrmr

A simple but nice webchat application with rooms and fun!

## Goals

The main goal of the 24 hour project is to create a web application that supports chatting between users, user instance manipulation, and chat room manipulation.

## Rules

No code can be written before April 21st, 2017 at 12:00 MST. However brainstorming/organization and concepts of ideas can be made prior (basically the idea can be developed).

## Facts about the project

- Our javascript will be strict to the idiomatic style guide to help with readability (see [here](https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js/)).
- All markdown documents will be strict to the style guide presented [here](https://github.com/mivok/markdownlint/blob/master/docs/RULES.md).
- All element styling will be done through classes in SCSS.
- HTML will be written in Handlebars (however not much if anything will be passed through the route as most information is passed through the websocket)
- The web server will be hosted on a raspberry pi that periodically pulls from the github. Commits to the repository should only be made when a feature is fully implemented.
- The address of the pi (only accessible on UCB Wireless Networks) will be [INSERT ADDRESS HERE] at the time of the event through May 12th, 2017.
