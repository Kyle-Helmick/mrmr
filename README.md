# mrmr

A simple but nice webchat application with rooms and fun!

## Goals

The main goal of the 24 hour project is to create a web application that supports chatting between users, user instance manipulation, and chat room manipulation.

## Rules

No code can be written before April 21st, 2017 at 12:00 MST. However brainstorming/organization and concepts of ideas can be made prior (basically the idea can be developed).

## Facts about the project

- Our javascript will be strict to the idiomatic style guide to help with readability [here](https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js/).
- All markdown documents will be strict to the style guide presented [here](https://github.com/mivok/markdownlint/blob/master/docs/RULES.md).
- All element styling will be done through classes in SCSS.
- HTML will be written in Handlebars (however not much if anything will be passed through the route as most information is passed through the websocket)
- The web server will be hosted ~~on a raspberry pi~~ at [mrmrchat.net](mrmrchat.net) through [heroku](heroku.com) and [domain.com](domain.com). Heroku pulls from the github on new commits that have been pushed. Commits to the repository should only be made when a feature is fully implemented.

## Bug Fixing and Tidying

Any features that we are working on or plan to work on will be posted on our Trello board [here](https://trello.com/b/Qnq9w4PC).
